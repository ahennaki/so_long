    so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,
    event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.
    You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally
    and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events

## Game

• The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route.

• The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.

• The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.

• The player should not be able to move into walls.

• At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.

• You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).

• The game doesn’t have to be real time.

• Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you want.

        If you prefer, you can use ZQSD or the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your main character.

## Graphic management


• Your program has to display the image in a window.

• The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).

• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.

• Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.

• The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

## Map

• The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free space.

• The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:

        0 for an empty space,
        1 for a wall,
        C for a collectible,
        E for a map exit,
        P for the player’s starting position.

Here is a simple valid map:

        1111111111111
        10010000000C1
        1000011111001
        1P0011E000001
        1111111111111

• The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to be valid.

If the map contains a duplicates characters (exit/start), you should display an error message.

• The map must be rectangular.

• The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return an error.

• You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.

• You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.

• Another example of a minimal .ber map:

        1111111111111111111111111111111111
        1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001
        1010010100100000101001000000010101
        1010010010101010001001000000010101
        1P0000000C00C0000000000000000000C1
        1111111111111111111111111111111111

• If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
